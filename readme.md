# Profile

Welcome to my profile. I've studied engineering and have since embarked on a journey to improve my programming skills. After countless small coding challeges on edabit and the likes, I have decided to start making small projects to improve my modern C++ skills and to get to know valuable tools, such as CMake and testing libraries.
